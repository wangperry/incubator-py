After I posted this article, various people wrote versions in different programming languages.
While the purpose of this article was to show the algorithms, not to highlight Python
(and certainly not to play "code golf" in an attempt to find the shortest program), the other
examples may be interesting for those who like comparing languages, or for those who want to
borrow an implementation in their desired language.
